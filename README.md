## Overview

**CyberCast** transforms India's cybercrime response from reactive to proactive. In financial cyber fraud, stolen funds are systematically withdrawn from ATMs within a 2-to-6 hour critical window. CyberCast leverages machine learning, geospatial clustering, and banking network intelligence to predict likely cash withdrawal hotspots before fraudsters reach the ATM terminal, enabling proactive law enforcement deployment and rapid CFCFRMS account freezes.
